Simple terminal program, use it, don't, if u ever meet me, buy me a cookie if you're appriciated with it.

### Running JULIET-DLP

Dependencies:
```python
pip install yt-dlp mpv
```
Runs in any os that runs python and that has the packages (dependencies) above.<br>It's easy to use with minimal difficulties. Don't expect good performance though.
