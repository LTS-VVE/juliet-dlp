Simple terminal program, use it, don't, for the goodness of open-source, the only thing that has sanity left in this world.

### Running JULIET-DLP

Dependencies:
```python
pip install yt-dlp mpv
```
<br>Then go to the directory of JULIET-DLP and run `python3 juliet-dlp.py`.
<br>It loads 50 results at a time, 50 trending results, and 50 + or more search results.
<br>You use the arrow keys `(up, down)`, to naviage the list of videos. Use `tab` to switch from trending results to search results.
<br>Use `q` or `ctr+c` to exit the program.
<br>Runs in any os that runs python and that has the packages (dependencies) above.<br>It's easy to use with minimal difficulties. Don't expect good performance though.

> [!NOTE]
> As mentioned above, it's slow as hell. So yeah.
